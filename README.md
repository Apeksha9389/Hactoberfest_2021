Next up clone the forked repo on to the local machine using:

git clone <copied-fork-link>

Run these command to add remote origin

git remote add origin <The url of forked github repository>
If this command give message like git remote already exist then run this command

git remote set-url origin <The url of forked github repository>
It is critical to keep your forked repository in sync the upstream repository so merge conflicts can be avoided:

git remote add upstream
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main
Create a seperate branch to work on:

The branch name must be selected according to the issue

git checkout -b <branch-name>

Contributors must follow the directory structure guidelines:

All files must be kept in a directory.
Directory name must resemble the issue assigned.
Based on the language used, create a directory inside the language directory.
Example: If I am writing in Python I will create a directory inside Python directory.
In case a project is being contributed make sure to add the files inside a directory(name according to project) which in turn must be placed inside the Projects directory.
Changes done by you will not affect existing structure of the project.
Add a README.md with your name and link to github profile using [your-name](link-to-profile)
After the contribution work is ready go ahead and add it to staging area:

git add -A

Now it is time to commit your changes and sync these changes to forked repo:

git commit -m <your_message>

git push origin <branch-name>

Issue a pull request from forked repo to this repo:
